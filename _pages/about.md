Brett Johnson is a Melburnian artist, living and working on Wurundjeri Country.
<br /> His primary work involves collage and mono-printing coloured paper on paper or wood.
<br /> Brett has not studied art formerly but relies on his training as a physicist to guide a semi-disciplined, self-directed journey into art. While his art practice is free and spontaneous, Brett also produces scientific illustrations  using computer graphics and has published 100+ journal articles.
<br /> Brett improvises rapidly with colour and composition to capture feelings inherent in personal creative expression - awe, wonder, peak experience and sometimes it's awkwardness, naivety and humour too.
